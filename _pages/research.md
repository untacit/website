## Tame Process Overload

End-users typically interact with several software systems to achieve goals such as Filing Income Tax, Planning Vacations or Writing Reports. Such interactions occur on a form-by-form basis, where the end-users input information and the software systems provide valuable feedback. This two-way interaction typically hides elaborate workflows that gather end-users, tasks, documents and software systems, and are used to control, document and standardize the interactions between parties such as end-users, businesses, governments and other organizations. For example, an end-user Planning a Vacation must provide the origin, the destination, the dates and the number of travellers to find a suitable flight. Moreover, if this end-user wants to buy the tickets, he/she must also provide credit card information. 

Considering regular end-users interact with several software systems (web-based, mobile, etc.) daily to achieve several goals, such users must "remember" how to navigate on each and every hidden workflow. In this <b>Process Overload</b> scenario, the may end-user face several issues: What is the required information to achieve my goal? How many interactions with the system do I need? 

To solve this problem, UnTacit graphical interface makes processes transparent, allowing end-users to understand the whole interaction upfront. {: .text-justify}

## Leverage on knowledge

A community of end-users interacting with software systems amasses valuable information on how goals can be achieved. The UnTacit back-end systems use intelligent Machine Learning algorithms to organize all this information and help end-users navigating through processes, thus avoiding possible unwanted situations. The help comes in the form of ChatBots that analyzes the process's context and recommends the most successful action towards achieving a goal. 

Moreover, the UnTacit Graphical Interface allows expert "Process Engineers" to upload workflows that can better describe an end-user context.

## Track and Manage Work

Users find themselves lost when executing hidden workflows. It is hard to remember if they are close to achieving a goal; if the system is waiting for information; or if the process is stuck at the organization's end. To manage your ongoing work, the UnTacit graphical interface helps you keep track of each executed tasks.
