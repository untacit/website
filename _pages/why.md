We have awesome solutions to help you navigate through tedious work.

## What if... 

1. User has lots of goals (Plan Trip, File Tax Return, Renew Driver's License,etc.)

2. Each goal leads to a website with its own bespoke "workflow" and interface

3. To achieve a goal, the User must "discover" each website workflow. Sometimes it is intuitive, but frequently it is "opaque" and  the user must seek assistance (forums, manuals, how-tos, help)

4. It is hard for the User to gather the info required to achieve such goal (What info?, How long? How many steps?, What happens if I get stuck along the way?)

5. It is hard for the User to stop and resume the "workflow" at any time.

6. It is hard for the User to remember what happened the last time he/she achieved such goal.

7. It is hard to obtain valuable information on how others "executed the workflow"(Name, Description, Author, Number of Executions, Number of Activities, Mean Execution Time, Information List, Number of Problems,etc)

What-if... 

The User could search/browse a list of "workflow definitions" to seek valuable information about the workflow?
