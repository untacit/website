End-users typically interact with several software systems to achieve goals such as Filing Income Tax, Planning Vacations or Writing Reports. Such interactions occur on a form-by-form basis, where the end-users input information and the software systems provide valuable feedback. This two-way interaction typically hides elaborate workflows that gather end-users, tasks, documents and software systems, and are used to control, document and standardize the interactions between parties such as end-users, businesses, governments and other organizations. For example, an end-user Planning a Vacation must provide the origin, the destination, the dates and the number of travellers to find a suitable flight. Moreover, if this end-user wants to buy the tickets, he/she must also provide credit card information. 

Considering regular end-users interact with several software systems (web-based, mobile, etc.) daily to achieve several goals, such users must "remember" how to navigate on each and every hidden workflow. In this <b>Process Overload</b> scenario, the may end-user face several issues: What is the required information to achieve my goal? How many interactions with the system do I need? .....

To solve this problem, UnTacit graphical interface make processes transparent, allowing end-users to understand the whole interaction upfront.
